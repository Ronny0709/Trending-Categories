# How did I start this project?

In my role as a research team member, I embarked on a project to identify the areas of interest of college students using YouTube's 'trending video' category. Recognizing that many college students frequently use YouTube, I aimed to streamline the process of producing relevant content by tapping into these trending topics.

Working closely with the content team, my task involved collecting and analyzing real-time data on videos whose views soared in Korea, Japan, and other countries. Using the YouTube API and Python, we gathered information on 50 trending videos daily, focusing on the video titles and channel information. This approach allowed us to infer channel recognition through metrics like view-to-like ratios, even though we couldn't delve into the detailed content of the videos.

# What is the goal of this project?
The primary objective of this project was to leverage YouTube's trending data to identify content trends and areas of interest among college students. By analyzing the 'trending video' category, we aimed to provide the content team with insights into what captivates the target audience's attention.

Initially, the plan involved scraping real-time data on trending videos and examining the metadata to understand the popularity dynamics. Despite the limitation of not accessing detailed content information of each videos, we focused on video titles, channel data, and engagement metrics to draw meaningful insights.

Ultimately, the goal is to enable the content team to create highly engaging content that aligns with current trends. Additionally, we aim to refine the project further to tailor content production to individual user preferences by categorizing areas of interest more precisely.

# Result
The final dataset was converted into a .csv format, which we used for further analysis. The insights gained from this data include trends that attract significant user attention, allowing the content team to produce highly engaging content. The project demonstrated the potential to understand user interests effectively through trending video data.

# Further Improvement
Furthermore, we are working on the project in a way that the content team can produce the latest trends tailored to each user by grasping the areas of interest of users by category. This approach will allow for more personalized and relevant content, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.
